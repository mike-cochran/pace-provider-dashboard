# Habitat Health Case Study - Enrollment Dashboard

This project contains a Streamlit dashboard that visualizes Medicare enrollment data across California counties.

## Overview

The dashboard provides two key visualizations:
1.  **Enrollment Trends**: A stacked bar chart showing enrollment growth over time for top counties.
2.  **Geographic Distribution**: A map of California displaying the latest enrollment numbers by county.

## Instructions for Non-Technical Users

If you do not have Python installed on your computer, please follow these steps to set up the environment and run the dashboard.

### Step 1: Install Python

1.  Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  Download the latest version for Windows.
3.  Run the installer. **IMPORTANT**: On the first screen of the installer, check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. This is crucial.
4.  Click "Install Now" and wait for the installation to finish.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1.  Open the folder containing these files.
2.  Right-click on an empty space in the folder while holding the `Shift` key (or just right-click in Windows 11) and select **"Open in Terminal"** or **"Open PowerShell window here"**.
3.  Type the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If that doesn't work, try:* `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 3: Run the Dashboard

Once the installation is complete, you can run the dashboard easily:

1.  **Double-click** the file named `run_dashboard.bat`.
2.  A terminal window will open, and shortly after, the dashboard will open in your default web browser.

Alternatively, you can run it from the terminal using:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
